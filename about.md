This is my personal blog for [blog.gnostech.net](http://blog.gnostech.net)

My interestes lie mostly in the realm of technology with a highly DIY bent.  I started out with a quest for the ultimate guitar tone which, got me into vacuum tube technology.  That was my first initiation into esoteric technology where the search for hidden knowledge took me into areas that most people found boring.  That is what makes me (and you) gnostechs.  It is the quest for elite knowledge beyond what your everyday user cares to know.

Along the way, I've discovered a love for open source software and hardware.  

Beyond the random post covering obscure and not so obscure tech, you may occasionally find a post or two that leans somewhat political or spiritual.  Those posts may offend your sensibilities.  You are under no obligation to read anything that you dislike.  My only request is that you refrain from adopting opinions about my character based solely on your perception of the representation of information encoded in various ways.  It may be that you lack all the information necessary to reach an entirely informed position.
